# A-comparative-study-related-to-SARS-Cov-2-COVID-19-and-its-variant-Omicron.
conduct a comparative study related to SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) and its variant

Omicron.

- GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) is a public database for SARS-Cov-2

sequences and its variants.

◦ It is a collaborative work between the German government and a non-profit organization

(Friends of GISAID).

◦ To access the GISAID data you need to register with an educational institution email

address (e.g. Cairo University). Then, wait sometime until your registration gets approved.

- Pick up only one country from any continent. This country must have sequences for both

SARS-Cov-2 and its Omicron variant.

- Download 10 SARS-Cov-2 sequences from the selected country.

◦ We will call them the reference sequences.

◦ Construct a consensus sequence from these sequences. At each sequence location, the

nucleotide/amino acid of the consensus sequence will be the most dominant one across all

the sequences at that location.

◦ We will use this consensus sequence as a single representation for the reference sequences.

- Download 10 sequences for the SARS-Cov-2 Omicron variant.

◦ We will call them the case sequences.

◦ Apply any multiple sequence alignment technique on these sequences.

- Ways of comparison:

- Construct a phylogenetic tree between all the above 20 sequencs.

- The average percentage of the chemical constituents (C, G, T, and A) and the CG content, if

  applicable, between the reference sequences and the case sequences.

- Extract the dissimilar regions/columns between the alignment of the case sequences and the

  consensus sequence (the representative reference).
